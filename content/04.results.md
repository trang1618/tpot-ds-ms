## Results
Our main goal is to test the performance of methods to identify features that discriminate between groups and optimize the classification accuracy.

### Simulated data
We compare the accuracy of each method for *r* = 100 replicate simulated data sets with moderate interaction effect. 
These values of the effect size in the simulations generate adequately challenging data sets so that the methods' accuracies stay moderate and do not cluster around 0.5 or 1. 
Each replicate data set is split into training and holdout. 
The TPOT-DS, standard TPOT and XGBoost models are built from the training dataset, and the trained model is then applied to the independent holdout data to obtain the generalization accuracy.

Our simulation design produces a reasonable distribution of the functional features, of which proportions in all subsets are shown in Table [S1].
According to Eq. {@eq:p_subset}, the earlier the subset, the more functional features it has.
Therefore, our first aim is to determine how well TPOT-DS can identify subset 1, which contains the largest number of informative features. 
With the specified template `Dataset Selector-Transformer-Classifier`, in 100 replications, TPOT-DS correctly selects subset 1 in the resulting pipeline [] times, with an average cross-validated accuracy on the training set of [] and out-of-sample accuracy of [] (Fig. [1]). 
Without DS, the standard TPOT and tuned XGBoost models respectively report a cross-validated accuracy of [] and [], and out-of-sample accuracy of [] and [0.565].

### RNA-Seq expression data
We apply standard TPOT, TPOT-DS and XGBoost to the RNA-Seq study of 78 major depressive disorder (MDD) subjects and 79 healthy controls described in [@doi:10.1038/s41398-018-0234-3].
The dataset contains 5,912 genes after preprocessing and filtering (see Methods for more detail).
In 100 replications, TPOT-DS selects DGM-4 (282 genes) [] times to be the subset most predictive of the diagnosis status.
