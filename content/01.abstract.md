## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems were considered as good data science assistant for automating time-consuming processes, like feature engineering, model selection and parameter optimization.
For this purpose, TPOT was developed for optimizing machine learning pipelines using strongly typed genetic programming and it keeps helping data scientists to search optimized analysis pipeline on their specific datasets.
But TPOT may suffer computational resource limits when working on big data, such as whole-genome expression data.
We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the systemâ€™s scalability: dataset selector (DS) and Template. Dataset selector provides the option to specify subsets of the features, reducing the computational expense of TPOT at the beginning of each pipeline to only evaluate on a smaller subset of data rather than the entire dataset. 
Consequently, DS makes TPOT applicable on large data sets by slicing the data into smaller sets of features and allowing genetic algorithm to select the best subset in the final pipeline.
Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed genetic programming.
We show that DS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and potentially provide more interpretable results.
Independent of a previous study that identified significant association with depressions severity of the enrichment scores of two modules, we find with TPOT-DS that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual.
