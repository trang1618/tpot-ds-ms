## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems are helpful data science assistants designed to scan the data for novel features, select an appropriate supervised learning model and optimize its parameters.
For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was developed using strongly typed genetic programming to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientist's prediction problem.
However, TPOT may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data.
We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the systemâ€™s scalability: Dataset selector and Template. 
Dataset selector (DS) provides the option to specify subsets of the features, assuming the signals come from specific subsets.
DS reduces the computational expense of TPOT at the beginning of each pipeline to only evaluate on a smaller subset of data rather than the entire dataset.
Consequently, DS makes TPOT applicable on big data by slicing the dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing genetic algorithm to select the best subset in the final pipeline.
Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed genetic programming and enables the incorporation of DS at the beginning of each pipeline.
We show that DS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and potentially provide more interpretable results.
Our simulations show TPOT-DS's outperformance compared to the a tuned XGBoost model and standard TPOT implementation.
We apply TPOT-DS to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder.
Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of the enrichment scores of two modules, TPOT-DS corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual.
