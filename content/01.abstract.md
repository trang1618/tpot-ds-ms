## Abstract {.page_break_before}

[Background, gap in field]
We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the systemâ€™s scalability: dataset selector (DS) and Template. Dataset selector provides the option to specify subsets of the features, reducing the computational expense of TPOT at the beginning of each pipeline to only evaluate on a smaller subset of data rather than the entire dataset. 
Consequently, DS makes TPOT applicable on large data sets by slicing the data into smaller sets of features and allowing genetic algorithm to select the best subset in the final pipeline. 
Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed genetic programming. 
We show that DS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and potentially provide more interpretable results.
Independent of a previous study that identified significant association with depressions severity of the enrichment scores of two modules, we find with TPOT-DS that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual.
