## Author Summary

Big data have recently become prevalent in many fields including meteorology, complex physics simulations, large scale imaging, genomics, biomedical research, environmental research and more.
TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tool that uses genetic programming to optimize machine learning pipelines for analyzing biomedical data.
However, like other AutoML tools, when analyzing big data, the early implementations of TPOT face the challenges of long runtime, high computational expense as well complex pipeline with low interpretability.
Here, we develop two novel features for TPOT, Dataset Selector and Template, that leverage domain knowledge, greatly reduce the computational expense and flexibly extend TPOT's application to biomedical big data analysis.
