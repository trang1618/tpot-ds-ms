## Author Summary

Big data become more and more popular in many fields, like meteorology, complex physics simulations, large scale imaging, genomics, biomedical research, environmental research and more.
TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming and has served as a data science assistant for helping user to find best analysis solution.
However, big data challenges this tool by extremely long runtime, highly computational expense as well complex pipeline with low interpretability.
To solve those issues, we added two features, Template and Dataset Selector, into TPOT to reduce computational expense with domain knowledges.
Our approaches make this data science assistant has more flexibility on big data analysis.
