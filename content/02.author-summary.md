## Author Summary

Big data have recently become prevalent in many fields including meteorology, complex physics simulations, large scale imaging, genomics, biomedical research, environmental research and more.
However, big data present challenges for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools that help data scientists find best analysis solution with the long runtime, high computational expense as well complex pipeline with low interpretability.
TPOT, a Python AutoML tool that uses genetic programming to optimize machine learning pipelines for analyzing biomedical data, faces the same challenges in the early implementations.
We developed two novel features for TPOT, Template and Dataset Selector, that leverage domain knowledge, greatly reduce the computational expense and flexibly extend TPOT's application to biomedical big data analysis.
