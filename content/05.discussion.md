## Discussion
To our knowledge, TPOT-DS is the first AutoML tool to offer the option of feature selection at the group level.
Previously, it was computationally expensive for any AutoML program to process biomedical big data.
TPOT-DS is able to identify the most meaningful group of features to include in the prediction pipeline. 
We assessed TPOT-DS's out-of-sample prediction accuracy compared to standard TPOT and XGBoost, another state-of-the-art machine learning method.
We applied TPOT-DS to real-world expression data to demonstrate the identification of biologically relevant groups of genes.

Implemented with a strongly typed GP, Template allows users to pre-specify a particular pipeline structure, which speeds up the automation computation time and provides potentially more interpretable results.
Hence, Template enables the comparison between the two TPOT implementations, with and without DS.

We simulated data of the similar scale and chalenging enough for the models to have similar predictive power as in the real-world RNA-Seq data.
TPOT-DS correctly selects the first subset (containing the most important features) 75% of the time with high holdout accuracy (0.69).
When another subset is chosen in the final pipeline, this method still produces holdout accuracy comparable to that of standard TPOT and XGBoost (0.565 - 0.575).

Interestingly enough, TPOT-DS repeatedly selects DGM-5 to include in the final pipeline. In a previous study, we showed DGM-5 and DGM-17 enrichment scores were significantly associated with depression severity [@doi:10.1038/s41398-018-0234-3].
We also remarked that DGM-5 contains many genes that are biologically relevant or previously associated with mood disorders [@doi:10.1038/s41398-018-0234-3] and its enriched pathways such as apoptosis indicates a genetic signature of MDD pertaining shrinkage of brain region-specific volume due to cell loss [@pmid:19125212;@pmid:10384158].

TPOT-DS also select DGM-13 as a potentially predictive group of features with smaller out-of-sample accuracy compared to DGM-5 (0.563 $<$ 0.636). []

It is important to discuss the complexity - interpretability trade-off in the context of AutoML.
While arbitrarily-shaped pipelines may yield predictions competitive to human-level performance, these pipelines are often too complex to be interpretable. 
Vice versa, a simpler pipeline with defined steps of operators may be easier to interpret but not yield the optimal accuracy.
Finding the optimal pipeline complexity that yields reasonable model interpretation and generalization remains a challenging task for AutoML application in biomedical big data.

Another limitation of this analysis is that subsets have to be predefined prior to executing TPOT-DS.
While this option is desirable when *a prior* knowledge on the biological data is available, it might pose as a challenge when this is not the case, such as when analyzing data of a brand-new disease.
Nevertheless, one can perform a clustering method such as *k*-means to group features prior to performing TPOT-DS on the data.

Extensions of TPOT-DS will involve overlapping subsets, which will require pipeline complexity reformulation beyond the total number of operators included in a pipeline.
Also, a future design to support tree structures for Template will enable TPOT-DS to identify more than one subset that have high predictive power of the outcome.
