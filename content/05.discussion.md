## Discussion

While the module scores of DGM-5 and DGM-17 were significantly associated with depressions severity measured by MADRS score [@doi:10.1038/s41398-018-0234-3], we find with TPOT-DS that DGM-4 is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis (MDD/HC) of each individual.

chalenging enough...

### Limitations

### Future works
Extensions of TPOT-DS will involve overlapping subsets, which will require pipeline complexity reformulation beyond the total number of operators included in a pipeline.
Also, a future design to support tree structures for Template will enable TPOT-DS to identify more than one subset that have high predictive power of the outcome.
